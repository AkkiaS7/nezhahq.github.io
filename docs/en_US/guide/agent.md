# Install Agent

**This document will introduce how to install the Agent on the monitored server and connect it to the Dashboard.**  
::: tip  
The repository for Agent binaries can be found at: <https://github.com/nezhahq/agent/releases>
:::

## One-Click Installation of the Agent

Nezha Monitoring supports one-click installation of the Agent on both Windows and Linux. By following the steps in this document, you can easily deploy it on your server.

### Preparation

You need to set up a communication domain in the admin panel in advance, and this domain should not be connected to a CDN. This document uses the example communication domain ‚Äúdata.example.com‚Äù.  
Go to the settings page in the admin panel, fill in the communication domain in the ‚ÄúNon-CDN Dashboard Server Domain/IP‚Äù field, and click "Save".

### One-Click Installation on Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS)

1. First, add a server in the admin panel.
2. Click the green Linux icon button next to the newly added server and copy the one-click installation command.
3. Run the copied installation command on the monitored server, and wait for the installation to complete. Then, check if the server is online in the Dashboard home page.

### One-Click Installation on Windows

1. First, add a server in the admin panel.
2. Click the green Windows icon button next to the newly added server and copy the one-click installation command.
3. Go to the Windows server, run PowerShell, and execute the copied installation command in PowerShell.
4. If you encounter a prompt to "change execution policy," choose Y.
5. Wait for the installation to complete, then check if the server is online in the Dashboard home page.

::: warning  
If you encounter errors when running the one-click installation command in PowerShell, try the **Manual Installation of the Agent on Windows** below.

## Other Ways to Install the Agent

### Installing the Agent on Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS)
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>

1. First, add a server in the admin panel.
2. Run the script on the monitored server:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naiba/nezha/master/script/install.sh -o nezha.sh && chmod +x nezha.sh && sudo ./nezha.sh
```

1. Select ‚ÄúInstall monitoring Agent.‚Äù
2. Enter the communication domain, such as "data.example.com".
3. Enter the dashboard communication port (gRPC port), default is 5555.
4. Enter the Agent secret, which is generated when you add a server in the admin panel and can be found on the ‚ÄúServers‚Äù page in the admin panel.
5. Wait for the installation to complete, then check if the server is online in the Dashboard home page.

***This section is adapted from [Mitsea Blog](https://blog.mitsea.com/e796f93db38d49e4b18df234c6ee75f5) with the author's permission***  
::: warning  
If you are prompted "macOS cannot verify this app" during installation, manually allow the program to run in System Settings.  
:::

1. First, add a server in the admin panel.
2. Go to the [Release](https://github.com/nezhahq/agent/releases) page to download the Agent binary file. Choose to download the darwin amd64 or arm64 Agent according to your CPU architecture. Download the amd64 version for Intel CPU, or the arm64 version for Apple Silicon. After downloading, unzip the Agent binary file, such as unzipping it to the Downloads folder.
3. Create a file named `nezha_agent.plist` and save it with the following content:

```xml  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
 <key>KeepAlive</key>
 <true/>
 <key>Label</key>
 <string>nezha_agent</string>
 <key>Program</key>
 <string>Modify the path to the Agent binary file here, such as: /Users/123/Downloads/nezha-agent</string>
 <key>ProgramArguments</key>
 <array>
  <string>Modify the path to the Agent binary file here, same as above</string>
  <string>--password</string>
  <string>The communication secret, such as: 529664783eeb23cc25</string>
  <string>--server</string>
  <string>The communication URL and gRPC port, such as: data.example.com:5555</string>
 </array>
 <key>RunAtLoad</key>
 <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

4. Load the plist file into launchd using the following command in Terminal, **make sure to replace the file path**:

```shell  
launchctl load /Users/123/Desktop/nezha_agent.plist
```

5. Start the process:

```shell  
launchctl start nezha_agent
```

6. Check if the process is running:

```shell  
launchctl list | grep nezha_agent
```

7. Stop the process and remove it:

```shell  
launchctl stop nezha_agent
```

```shell  
launchctl remove nezha_agent
```

***This section is adapted from [üêøÔ∏èÊùæÈº†Êî∂ÈõÜüå∞](https://blog.mre.red/archives/install_nezha_monitoring_agent_service_with_homebrew) with the author's permission***

::: warning	
Please be sure to add environment variables before installing nezha-agent through Homebrew!
Homebrew creates the service-required plist file during software installation, and if you add the environment variables after installation, it will fail to start due to missing parameters.
:::

1. Add environment variables:

```shell
echo 'export HOMEBREW_NEZHA_AGENT_PASSWORD="Communication key, obtained from the service page"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export HOMEBREW_NEZHA_AGENT_SERVER="Your server and port, format your.domain:5555 "' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

2. Install Nezha Agent:

::: danger
Note that this Homebrew repository is maintained by a third party and is unrelated to Nezha Monitoring.
The Nezha project team does not endorse this repository's usability, security, etc. Please evaluate the risks yourself before using!
:::

Since it has not yet been submitted to the Homebrew Core official library, it is temporarily placed in the [third-party Homebrew repository](https://github.com/Brewforge/homebrew-chinese) maintained by the author of the blog:

```shell
brew install brewforge/chinese/nezha-agent
```

3. Start Nezha Agent service through Homebrew:

```shell
brew services start nezha-agent
```

4. Check the service status:

```shell
brew services info nezha-agent
```

5. Stop the service:

```shell
brew services stop nezha-agent
```

6. Uninstall Nezha Agent:

```shell
brew rm nezha-agent
```

7. If there is an error, first check the environment variables:

```shell
echo $HOMEBREW_NEZHA_AGENT_PASSWORD
echo $HOMEBREW_NEZHA_AGENT_SERVER
```

8. If the environment variables are configured correctly, try reinstalling:

```shell
brew services stop nezha-agent
brew reinstall nezha-agent
brew services start nezha-agent
```

9. If the issue persists, submit a issue to the [third-party Homebrew repository](https://github.com/Brewforge/homebrew-chinese).

### Installing the Agent on OpenWRT
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand/collapse</summary>

**How to solve installation difficulties and issues in one step?**

* Refer to the project:  
[NZ-OpenWrt](https://github.com/dysf888/NZ-OpenWrt)  

**How to enable autostart on older OpenWRT/LEDE?**

* Refer to the project:  
[Nezha Monitoring for OpenWRT](https://github.com/Erope/openwrt_nezha)  

**How to enable autostart on newer OpenWRT? Contributor: @ËâæÊñØÂæ∑ÊñØ**

* First, download the corresponding binary from the release, unzip the zip package, and place it in `/root`.
* Run `chmod +x /root/nezha-agent` to grant execution permission, then create `/etc/init.d/nezha-service`:

```shell
#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common

START=99
USE_PROCD=1

start_service() {
 procd_open_instance
 procd_set_param command /root/nezha-agent -s Dashboard communication domain:port -p Key -d
 procd_set_param respawn
 procd_close_instance
}

stop_service() {
  killall nezha-agent
}

restart() {
 stop
 sleep 2
 start
}
```

* Run `chmod +x /etc/init.d/nezha-service` to grant execution permission.  
* Start the service: `/etc/init.d/nezha-service enable && /etc/init.d/nezha-service start`

## Does the Agent Have a Docker Image?

**The Agent does not currently have a Docker image.**  
The design philosophy of the Agent is opposite to that of the Dashboard. While the Dashboard should minimally impact the server, the Agent needs to execute monitoring services and run commands within the server.  
Running the Agent inside a container can still perform monitoring tasks, but features like WebShell will not function properly, so no Docker image is provided.
