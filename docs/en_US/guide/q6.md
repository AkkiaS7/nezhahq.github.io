# How to Reset Traffic Statistics Monthly?

The traffic statistics on the homepage reset every time the server restarts. To achieve a monthly reset of the traffic counter, you can do the following:

1. Go to the `Notification` page in the management panel.
2. Refer to [this document](/en_US/guide/notifications.html#special-any-cycle-transfer-notification) to create a monthly traffic notification.
3. Return to the homepage and go to the `Services` page, where you can see the monthly traffic statistics. The statistics here will not reset when the server restarts.

::: tip
This method allows you to set any period, including but not limited to hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly traffic statistics reset, offering great flexibility!
