#### Other Flags

Run `./nezha-agent --help` to view supported flags，if you are already using the one-click script, you can edit `/etc/systemd/system/nezha-agent.service`，at the end of this line `ExecStart=` add:  

- `--report-delay` System information reporting interval, default is 1 second, can be set to 3 to reduce the system resource usage on the agent side (configuration range 1-4)
- `--skip-conn` Not monitoring the number of connections, if it is a server with a large number of connections, the CPU usage will be high. It is recommended to set this to reduce CPU usage
- `--skip-procs` Disable monitoring the number of processes can also reduce CPU and memory usage
- `--disable-auto-update` Disable **Automatic Update** Agent (security feature)
- `--disable-force-update` Disable **Forced Update** Agent (security feature)
- `--disable-command-execute` Disable execution of scheduled tasks, disallow WebShell (security feature)
