#### Let the Agent start/on-line, and the self-test process of the problem
1. Run `//opt/nezha/agent/nezha-agent -s IP/Domin(Panel IP or Domain not connected to CDN):port(Panel RPC port) -p secret(Agent Secret) -d` Check the logs to see if the timeout is due to a DNS problem or poor network  
2. `nc -v domain/IP port(Panel RPC port)` or `telnet domain/IP port(Panel RPC port)` to check if it' s a network problem, check the inbound and outbound firewall between the local machine and the panel server, if you can' t determine the problem you can check it with the port checking tool provided by <https://port.ping.pe/>   
3. If the above steps work and the Agent is online, please try to turn off SELinux on the panel server. [How to close SELinuxï¼Ÿ](https://www.google.com/search?q=How+to+disable+SELinux)
